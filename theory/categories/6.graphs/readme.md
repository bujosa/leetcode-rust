# Graphs 

## Theory

### Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components:

- A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
- A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.

### Graph Implementation

A graph can be implemented using an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.
