# Array & Hashing

## Theory

### Arrays

- Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory.
- Arrays are stored in the stack.
- Arrays are accessed by index.
- Arrays are fixed in size.
- Arrays are faster than linked lists.

### Hashing

- Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.
- Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value.
- It is also used in many encryption algorithms.

### Hash Table

- A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

### Hash Function

- A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.

### Hash Collisions

- A hash collision is a situation where a hash function produces the same hash value for two different pieces of data.

### Hashing Techniques

- Direct Addressing
- Modulo Hashing
- Universal Hashing
- Double Hashing
- Separate Chaining
- Open Addressing

#### Direct Addressing

- Direct addressing is a technique in which the key value is used as an index to access the table.
- It is used when the keys are small integers.
- It is not suitable for large keys.

#### Modulo Hashing

- Modulo hashing is a technique in which the key value is used as an index to access the table.

#### Universal Hashing

- Universal hashing is a technique in which the key value is used as an index to access the table.

#### Double Hashing

- Double hashing is a technique in which the key value is used as an index to access the table.

#### Separate Chaining

- Separate chaining is a technique in which the key value is used as an index to access the table.

#### Open Addressing

- Open addressing is a technique in which the key value is used as an index to access the table.
